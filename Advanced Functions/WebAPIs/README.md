Techniques for implementation of common browser APIs that are built on top of client-side javascript, provide a lot of useful features. Most important of such APIs are the **Web APIs** that communicate and interact with remote server and retrieve data. This has had a huge impact on the performance and behavior of sites, fetching data and updating instantly without having to reload the whole page from the server can make the site or app feel much more responsive and "snappy".

Specify following optional parameters while making a Http Request for using an API.

- api endpoint
- query string
- headers
- body
