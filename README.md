## Introduction üìú

### Get up to speed with DOM manipulation techniques using JS and more through these scripts and snippets. </b> 

</br>

<b>HTML or XML documents expose an interface knowns as DOM (Document Object Model) to the browser, it's tags provide structure and hierarchy or parent-child relationships among the elements and also act as labels. 

The DOM structure and style can be manipulated by a scripting language (typically JS) that leads to infinite possibilities only limited by your creativity. This repo hosts collection of such exciting features as well as practical snippets to help beginners get up to speed and provide something new to intermediates and experts alike.</b>

Knowing DOM manipulation is very important if we want to do any kind of software development work. It's ubiquitous and finds it's application everywhere weather it's  web , mobile , front-end or even back-end. Even in projects where most of the code is in other languages there is some element of it , since ‚Äúweb interfaces‚Äù (HTTP/HTML/CSS/JavaScript) have become the standard in how to deliver applications to people, both on the consumer side and on the enterprise side.
Even frameworks such as angular , node , vue , react encapsulate and hide the DOM directly but still require working with the DOM at a certain level.

### Contribution Features

- [x] Any script that shows DOM element manipualtion
- [x] Any script that shows the working of a specific js method
- [x] Any JS techniques that's commonly used.
- [x] Implementation of a specific functionality.
- [x] Live Demos or easy to understand examples.

In programming and scripting there is no one method that's the `best way`.
There can be several approaches that do the same thing but are welcome as it is always useful to add new techniques to your skillset.
Also coming up with more than 1 solution is very important for those who are in a learning phase, this may help in broadening the overall understanding of the language.

**Note :**
- No external libraries , only native browser's APIs and vanilla JS.
- Work with modern browsers. Try to support IE 11.
